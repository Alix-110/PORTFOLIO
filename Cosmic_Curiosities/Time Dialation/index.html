  <h2>1. What is Time Dilation?</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <img src="3.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein" class="card-img">
    <p>
      Time dilation is a prediction of Einstein’s relativity: clocks move differently depending on speed and gravity.
      Clocks moving fast or in strong gravity tick slower. This has been experimentally verified with satellites and atomic clocks.

  <h2>2. Gravity Slows Time</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <img src="2.jpg" alt="Black Hole" class="card-img">
    <p>
      Near massive objects like black holes, time flows slower. For example, 1 hour near a black hole can equal 7 years on Earth.

  <h2>3. Speed Slows Time</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <img src="6.jpeg" alt="Spaceship at High Speed" class="card-img">
    <p>
      High-speed travel causes time to slow. Astronauts on the ISS age slightly slower than people on Earth. At near-light speed, the effect is extreme.

  <h2>4. GPS and Time Dilation</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <img src="7.jpg" alt="GPS Satellite" class="card-img">
    <p>
      GPS satellites move fast and are farther from Earth’s gravity, causing their clocks to tick differently. Engineers adjust clocks so GPS works accurately.

  <h2>5. Fascinating Time Dilation Facts</h2>
  <ul class="facts">
    <li>Astronauts age milliseconds less on Earth.</li>
    <li>Time almost stops near a black hole.</li>
    <li>Traveling at 99% the speed of light for 5 years = thousands of years on Earth.</li>
    <li>Measured with atomic clocks.</li>
    <li>Your feet age slower than your head due to gravity differences!</li>
