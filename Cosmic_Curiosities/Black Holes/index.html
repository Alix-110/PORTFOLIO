      <h2>Introduction to Black Holes</h2>
      <p>
        A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. 
        They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity after exhausting nuclear fuel. 
        Black holes warp spacetime around them, creating extreme gravitational effects that influence nearby stars and light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their mysterious nature, black holes have been studied extensively through their interaction with matter, 
        radiation, and gravitational waves. Their study has deepened our understanding of physics, cosmology, 
        and the fabric of the universe itself.

  <!-- SECTION 2: Event Horizon & Singularity -->

      <h2>Event Horizon & Singularity</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>event horizon</strong> is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape. 
        Crossing it is the point of no return. The singularity, at the core of a black hole, is a point of infinite density 
        where classical physics breaks down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extreme gravity near the event horizon causes <strong>gravitational time dilation</strong>. 
        Time moves slower near the black hole compared to a distant observer. This effect has been confirmed by 
        observations of stars orbiting supermassive black holes and is a key prediction of Einstein's theory of relativity.

  <!-- SECTION 3: Types of Black Holes -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="glass-card">
      <img src="6.webp" alt="Supermassive Black Hole">
      <h2>Types of Black Holes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes:</strong> Formed from the collapse of massive stars, usually 3–20 solar masses.</li>
        <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes:</strong> Found in galaxy centers, millions to billions of solar masses.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes:</strong> Hypothetical medium-sized black holes, bridging stellar and supermassive types.</li>
        <li><strong>Primordial Black Holes:</strong> Hypothetical black holes formed in the early universe, tiny but dense.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Supermassive black holes influence galaxy formation and can power quasars, the brightest objects in the universe.

      <h2>Interactive Black Hole Simulation</h2>
      <p>
        The simulation below demonstrates how matter orbits a black hole, showing the curvature of spacetime 
        around the event horizon. Particles spiral toward the center, mimicking accretion disks observed in real black holes.

  <!-- SECTION 5: Fascinating Facts -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="glass-card">
      <h2>Fascinating Facts & Theories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Black holes emit Hawking radiation very slowly, eventually evaporating over billions of years.</li>
        <li>Gravitational waves are produced when black holes merge, rippling through spacetime.</li>
        <li>Our Milky Way contains a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*.</li>
        <li>Theoretical wormholes could connect distant regions of spacetime via black holes.</li>
        <li>Accretion disks heat up matter to millions of degrees, emitting X-rays detectable by telescopes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Black holes remain one of the most mysterious objects in astrophysics, bridging theoretical physics, 
        cosmology, and observational astronomy.
